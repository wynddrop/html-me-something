    <p>What does sailing me to me?&nbsp  To me it is tranquil and relaxing.</p>
    <p>I was first introduced to sailing by a good friend of mine.&nbsp  He took me out on a late fall day during the week to show me the fall foliage.&nbsp  I just remember how peaceful and beautiful it was and how at peace it made me feel.</p>
    <p>From the first day, I was hooked.&nbsp  I spent much of the next few years learning what I could about sailing.&nbsp  I sailed most weekends with my new friends.&nbsp  Many times helping them with races or even taking guests out on the lake.&nbsp  But what I most missed was the peace.</p>
    <p>I traded for a boat of my own about 4 years ago.&nbsp  I spent that first year learning to sail her.&nbsp  I named my boat &quotTranquility&quot.&nbsp  The last few years I have not had the time to take her out on the water, but look forward to next summer when I will finally have time.&nbsp  </p>
