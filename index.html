    <p>What does sailing me to me?  To me it is tranquil and relaxing.</p>
    <p>I was first introduced to sailing by a good friend of mine.  He took me out on a late fall day during the week to show me the fall foliage.  I just remember how peaceful and beautiful it was and how at peace it made me feel.</p>
    <p>From the first day, I was hooked.  I spent much of the next few years learning what I could about sailing.  I sailed most weekends with my new friends.  Many times helping them with races or even taking guests out on the lake.  But what I most missed was the peace.</p>
    <p>I traded for a boat of my own about 4 years ago.  I spent that first year learning to sail her.  I named my boat Tranquility.  The last few years I have not had the time to take her out on the water, but look forward to next summer when I will finally have time.  </p>
